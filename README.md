# console_drawing_machine
Experimenting with code design. Injecting and composition.

To test it run in the command line.
It should start a sin wave figure that adjusts to the width and height of the window.
bundle exec console_drawing_machine.rb sin

The purpose of this exercise is to make a program flexible by isolating features in tiny classes
and use injection and composition to make the application very flexible.
